## üåü About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm a Logistics Systems Analyst with over 5 years of experience improving how distribution centers operate ‚Äî one process, report, and system enhancement at a time.

I specialize in turning operational chaos into clarity, using tools like SQL, Manhattan WMS, and SAP S4 to uncover insights and implement solutions that make a real difference. From increasing system efficiency across multiple locations to leading cross-functional projects, I thrive where tech meets logistics.

What sets me apart? I don‚Äôt just analyze ‚Äî I solve, optimize, and deliver. I‚Äôve built tools that save hours of manual work, led initiatives that boosted productivity, and helped teams work smarter with data-backed decisions.

I'm currently open to opportunities where I can bring my technical and analytical skills to a collaborative, growth-focused environment. If you're looking for someone who understands the details but thinks big-picture, we should talk.

Let's stay in touch! Feel free to connect with me here:
