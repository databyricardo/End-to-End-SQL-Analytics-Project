# End-to-End SQL Analytics Project

This project demonstrates a complete SQL-based analytics workflow‚Äîfrom database creation to advanced reporting. Designed for data analysts and BI professionals, it provides a structured, modular approach to explore, analyze, and extract actionable insights from a sales dataset. Each SQL script focuses on a specific analytical task, showcasing best practices and real-world business logic.

---

## ‚úÖ What This Project Covers

- Database setup with star schema (dimensional modeling)

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) across dimensions and dates

- Aggregated metrics & KPIs (sales, quantity, orders, customers)

- Time-series and cumulative trend analysis

- Performance tracking: YoY/MoM comparisons using window functions

- Customer and product segmentation

- Executive-level reporting with KPIs and dynamic views

| `09_performance_analysis.sql`      | Measures YoY performance and average comparisons using `LAG()` and `AVG()` windows.         |
| `10_data_segmentation.sql`         | Segments customers and products based on behavior and cost tiers.                           |
| `11_part_to_whole_analysis.sql`    | Evaluates category contributions to total sales (percent of whole).                         |
| `12_report_customers.sql`          | Creates a view summarizing customer KPIs: recency, average order value, monthly spend, etc. |
| `13_report_products.sql`           | Builds a product performance view with segmentation, AOR, and revenue metrics.              |

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- SQL for data profiling and schema exploration

- Dimensional modeling (star schema: fact + dimensions)

- Aggregate & window functions (SUM(), LAG(), OVER())

- Conditional logic with CASE for segmentation

- Trend & cohort analysis

- Report generation using SQL views

## üìä Visualizing Insights with Power BI

As a bonus to the SQL analytics, I built a Power BI dashboard to visualize key patterns in customer behavior and sales performance.
