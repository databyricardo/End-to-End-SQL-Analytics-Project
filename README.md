| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `00_init_database.sql`             | Creates and loads a full analytics database with dimensional tables.                        |
| `01_database_exploration.sql`      | Explores schema, table structures, and metadata.                                            |
| `02_dimensions_exploration.sql`    | Analyzes unique values in customer and product dimensions.                                  |
| `03_date_range_exploration.sql`    | Examines time coverage and customer age distribution.                                       |
| `04_measures_exploration.sql`      | Computes high-level KPIs: total sales, orders, quantities, etc.                             |
| `05_magnitude_analysis.sql`        | Breaks down key metrics by categories like gender, country, and product.                    |
| `06_ranking_analysis.sql`          | (Can be added next — ranking top customers/products by sales, etc.)                         |
| `07_change_over_time_analysis.sql` | Analyzes sales and customer trends over time.                                               |
| `08_cumulative_analysis.sql`       | Builds cumulative KPIs using window functions.                                              |
| `09_performance_analysis.sql`      | Measures YoY performance and average comparisons using `LAG()` and `AVG()` windows.         |
| `10_data_segmentation.sql`         | Segments customers and products based on behavior and cost tiers.                           |
| `11_part_to_whole_analysis.sql`    | Evaluates category contributions to total sales (percent of whole).                         |
| `12_report_customers.sql`          | Creates a view summarizing customer KPIs: recency, average order value, monthly spend, etc. |
| `13_report_products.sql`           | Builds a product performance view with segmentation, AOR, and revenue metrics.              |

## 🌟 About Me

Hi, I’m a Logistics Systems Analyst with over 5 years of experience improving how distribution centers operate — one process, report, and system enhancement at a time.

I specialize in turning operational chaos into clarity, using tools like SQL, Manhattan WMS, and SAP S4 to uncover insights and implement solutions that make a real difference. From increasing system efficiency across multiple locations to leading cross-functional projects, I thrive where tech meets logistics.

What sets me apart? I don’t just analyze — I solve, optimize, and deliver. I’ve built tools that save hours of manual work, led initiatives that boosted productivity, and helped teams work smarter with data-backed decisions.

I'm currently open to opportunities where I can bring my technical and analytical skills to a collaborative, growth-focused environment. If you're looking for someone who understands the details but thinks big-picture, we should talk.

Let's stay in touch! Feel free to connect with me here:
